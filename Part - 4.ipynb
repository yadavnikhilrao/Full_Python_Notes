    "# Object Oriented Programming System (OOPs)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) \n",
    "1. Class and Objects\n",
    "2. Encapsulation\n",
    "3. Abstraction\n",
    "4. Inheritance\n",
    "5. Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object oriented programming language like Java, it does not force the programmers to write program in complete object oriented way. Unlike Java. Python has a blend of both the object oriented and procedure oriented features. Hence, Python programmers can write programs using procedure oriented approach (like C) or object oriented (like Java) depending on their requirements. This is definitely an advantage for Python programmers!"

This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.\n",

Similarly, the sales section handles all the sales-related activities and keeps records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation when due to some reason an official from the finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of the sales section and the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”. Using encapsulation also hides the data. In this example, the data of the sections like sales, finance, or accounts are hidden from any other section.\n",

If the child class not satisfied with parent class implementation then child class is allowed to redefine that method in the child class based on its requirement. This concept is called overriding.\n",
