    "4. INFO===>20===>Represents a message with some important information\n",

    "\n",
    "The process of identifying and fixing the bug is called debugging.\n",
    "Very common way of debugging is to use print() statement. But the problem with the print() statement is after fixing the bug,compulsory we have to delete the extra added print() statments,otherwise these will be executed at runtime which creates performance problems and disturbs console output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this problem we should go for assert statement. The main advantage of \n",
